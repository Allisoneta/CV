<h1>Pets</h1>
<p>Right know, I own 1 dog named Tokyo, he lives at my house and loves to travel to new places, he eats lots of food, he spends the majority of the time sleeping and playing with his toys. Tokyo was rescued from an abusive owner and is living his best life with us. Before Tokyo I had one dog named Tato that was my dog since I was born, he died at the age of 19 years old and I also owned a hamster that was given to me from school when I was at 2nd grade, the hamster was named Sky but she unfortunately died by an eye infection.</p>

<h1>Story Time</h1>
<p>I remember that when I was 7 years old, my family and I went to Orlando in the United States, and we were having a great time visiting places but one day we went to a mall to buy things for me and for my parents and what happened is that I got entertained with a toy and my parents where focused in searching clothes for me and they thought I was behing them, but they went too far and when I realized I wasn't with my parents I started panicking I started to look behind many places but I didn't found them until my mom realized I was lost and she asked a security guard from the shop to help her find me. Eventually, they did find me after 5 minutes. For the time it happened I was scared but now it's just a story time that I remember. </p>
